# Art&Design
Website developed for the System Analysis course. This project's goal was to implement the Agile methodology in the development of a platform.
This website was made during some of the iterations of that process.

## Tools Used

This project uses a different number of tools:

- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) - Asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime
- [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for Node.js
- [**EJS**](https://ejs.co/) - Embedded JavaScript templating
- [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) - An app development platform by Google
- [**nicepage**](https://nicepage.com/) - Website builder software

The overall look and feel of the website was built using the nicepage platform. Node allied with Express are used for the backend. EJS allows the display of some dynamic information. Finally, Firebase is used to handle a user's register and login processes.
